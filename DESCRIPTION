Description: Implements various distance and divergence measures between 
    multivariate normal distributions, including Fisher-Rao (numerical), 
    Wasserstein-2 (Bures), Hellinger, Bhattacharyya, affine-invariant, and 
    Kullback-Leibler distances. Provides geodesic computation on the manifold 
    of multivariate normal distributions using different Riemannian metrics.
